# Usage:
This project allows you to perform Payforblob transactions on the Celestia network with just one click. Several files written in the Python programming language are required for the project to work. These files provide a web interface that contains the necessary information for Payforblob transactions and send requests to the Celestia network.

A Payforblob transaction is used to pay for a blob data. In this transaction, a specified amount of Tia (celestia test token) is paid and the payment is stored as a blob under a specified Namespace ID. This allows the blob data to be stored on the network and accessed at any time.

The project is built using Flask, a popular tool for developing web applications in the Python language. Other components of the project include the 'requests' library used to send requests to the Celestia network and the 'random' library used to generate a random Namespace ID.

This project allows you to manage Payforblob transactions with a simple and user-friendly interface. Once you have entered the required information correctly, you can easily perform Payforblob transactions.

# How it Works?
### 1- To get started, you need to access the website. Once you are on the website, you will be asked to enter your Node IP and Port information. Before starting Celestia Blockspacerace-0, make sure to set the gateway as 0.0.0.0. After entering the information, click the submit button and wait for the output. Port always "26659"

### 2- A successful output example would be as follows. You can copy the output on the right side of the "Transaction Hash" text and access the details of your transaction on the explorer mentioned in step 3.
